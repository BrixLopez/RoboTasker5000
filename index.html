> Welcome to our website, and thank you for your interest in the RoboTasker 5000, our newest offering (RT5000). The RT5000 is a programmable robot made to assist families with common household tasks. It can carry out multiple physical chores that a human can thanks to its arms and wheels, making it the perfect assistant for busy families.
> Users can set the RT5000 to perform an array of household tasks using an app that controls it. A touchscreen located on the top of the robot's head allows users to customize the task by input different features. Users can customize how to clean different rooms in their house or schedule the robot to begin a cleaning duty at a specified time, for instance.
